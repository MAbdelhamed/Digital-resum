Creating hidden file
 Firstly we have to create the file with the command touch file.txt
Then we can hide it with the command attrib +h file.txt
Displaying it and its content in cli
Firstly assume that we are at the same folder so we can write the command ls to get folder elements
then we can use the command cat file.txt to display the file content
 
 creating multible nested directories
you can do this with the command mkdir -p these/folders/just/for/fun/

 appending message without new line
by the command echo -n first >>file.txt then we can append echo message >>file.txt
to add another one like the example shown same steps echo -n second >>file.txt then we can append by echo message>>file.txt
